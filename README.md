This is our PLT project egrapher.    
Write a valid file_name.eg file with eGrapher syntax.  
Inside the eGrapher folder, run “make.”   
This creates the eGrapher to LLVM compiler, “egrapher.native”.     
Once the compiler is made, run “./hellotest.sh file_name.eg” to compile a eGrapher program to LLVM and run the file.     
This script compiles your code to llvm and execute it.    
After you finish running the program, just run make clean to delete all generated file, the IRs and executable after execution.
